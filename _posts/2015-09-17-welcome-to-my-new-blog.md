So far everything I have written was short enough or has been made short enough by me to fit into a [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/101390620047921378812/posts) post. Today I felt like that is no longer enough space.

Therefore, I decided to start this blog where I will regularly post articles about my encounters in the free software world and give updates on my free software projects. I hope that it will inspire some people in the same way blogs like [Riccardo's](http://rpadovani.com) have inspired me.
That being said, I will still post smaller updates on [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/101390620047921378812/posts).

Now I am looking forward to writing my first real post on here.
