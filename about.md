I am Niklas Wenzel.

I am a hobby software developer and a free software enthusiast. Currently, I am contributing a lot to the [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) project.
I contribute to the core apps and love hacking on the notification backend of the Ubuntu Phone.

In the past, I have participated in various other projects as well, including [Cantata](https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata) and [Pocket Code](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.catrobat.catroid). Furthermore, I have developed a [library for Android applications](https://github.com/nikwen/DynamicShareActionProvider) and a [cool app for browsing forums](https://uappexplorer.com/app/com.ubuntu.developer.nikwen.forum-app) which are both quite popular.
